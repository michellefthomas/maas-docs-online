<div class="section" id="how-does-on-demand-billing-compare-to-prepaid-subscriptions">
<h1>How does On Demand billing compare to Prepaid subscriptions?</h1>
<p>On Demand billing charges you monthly based on your service and data usage, whereas Prepaid subscriptions charge you a flat fee for a pre-determined number of service hours at a discounted rate.
You could use a mix of both On Demand and Prepaid subscriptions in your account. Most customers will purchase Prepaid subscriptions for applications with predictable usage,
and use on-demand to cover any overages, for new applications or for those applications with variable usage.</p>

<h1>What clouds and regions are available?</h1>
<p>This information is available at the bottom of our <a class="reference external" href="https://solace.com/cloud/pricing/">pricing page</a>. We are always adding more clouds and regions based on demand. If you don't see a region that you need, please get in touch with us by using the <a class="reference external" href="https://console.solace.cloud/support">support page in our console</a>.

<div class="section" id="why-aren-t-all-of-the-regions-listed-on-the-pricing-page-available-when-i-m-creating-a-service">
<h1>Why aren't all of the regions listed on the <a class="reference external" href="https://solace.com/cloud/pricing/">pricing page</a> available when I'm creating a service?</h1>
<p>Only certain regions are available when creating a Free service. Free service regions are marked with an asterisk on our <a class="reference external" href="https://solace.com/cloud/pricing/">pricing page</a>. Even if you're not using a Free service, you may notice that some regions are not available. This is because we list all of the "Available" regions on our website, while only the "Enabled" regions can be used when creating a service.</p>
<p>"Available" regions are those which have been identified as having the IaaS resources that are required to run our messaging services. "Enabled" regions are those in which PubSub+ Cloud infrastructure is installed and ready to create messaging services.</p>
</div>
